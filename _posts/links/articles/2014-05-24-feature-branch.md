#### [FeatureBranch] by [Martin Fowler], 2009.

##### Abstract (article introduction)

With the rise of Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) such as git and Mercurial, [I][Martin Fowler]'ve seen more conversations about strategies for branching and merging and how they fit in with Continuous Integration (CI). There's a bit of confusion here, particularly on the practice of feature branching and how it fits in with CI.


##### Personnal opinion

A very interesting discussion about feature branching using dvcs and how to handle or avoid it with continuous integration. You can find in the article clear examples of feature branching, continuous integration and the introduction of promiscuous integration.
