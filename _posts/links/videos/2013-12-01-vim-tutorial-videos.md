#### [Vim Tutorial Videos] by [Derek Wyatt], 2009-2010 ####

I’ve been doing some video tutorials that are hosted on vimeo for a little while now and they’ve reached a decent critical mass. However, they aren’t all that well organized – not that vimeo doesn’t give you a decent way to organize them, it’s just that I’m incredibly cheap and you need to pay an upgrade fee to get an unlimited number of albums. So I organize them a bit better here. Check the child pages to see what videos are available.
