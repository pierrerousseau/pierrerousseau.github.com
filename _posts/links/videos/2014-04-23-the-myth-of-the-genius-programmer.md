#### [The Myth of the Genius Programmer] by [Brian Fitzpatrick] and [Ben Collins-Sussman], 2009.

##### Abstract (video about)

A pervasive elitism hovers in the background of collaborative software development: everyone secretly wants to be seen as a genius. In this talk, we discuss how to avoid this trap and gracefully exchange personal ego for personal growth and super-charged collaboration. We'll also examine how software tools affect social behaviors, and how to successfully manage the growth of new ideas.


##### Personnal opinion

Don't be afraid, code, code more, share your codes, and when it's bad ? Correct it ! Do not keep it secretely wrong !
