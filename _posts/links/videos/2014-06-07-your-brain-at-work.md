##### Abstract (video about)

In his new book *Your Brain at Work*, coach David Rock depicts the story of two people over one day at the office, and what's happening in their brains that makes it so hard to focus and be productive. Not only does he explain why things go wrong, but how you can train your brain to improve thinking and performance at work. Based on interviews with 30 neuroscientists, he's developed strategies to help you work smart all day.

Learn how to:
* Maximize your mental energy by understanding your brain's limits
* Overcome distractions
* Improve your focus through understanding the nature of attention
* Reduce stress levels with brain-based techniques
* Improve how you collaborate by understanding the social needs of the brain

You can learn to be more productive, less stressed and stay sane by understanding your brain.


##### Personnal opinion

Interresting tips on how to change the context you are handling things. I really liked the one about a late plane. If you can't do anything to speed up a late plane, use this "lost" time for something else. You'll be less nervous, and you will have done something instead of just complaining.
