#### [A successful Git branching model] by [Vincent Driessen], 2010.

In this post I present the development model that I’ve introduced for all of my projects (both at work and private) about a year ago, and which has turned out to be very successful. I’ve been meaning to write about it for a while now, but I’ve never really found the time to do so thoroughly, until now. I won’t talk about any of the projects’ details, merely about the branching strategy and release management.


#### [FeatureBranch] by [Martin Fowler], 2009.

With the rise of Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) such as git and Mercurial, I've seen more conversations about strategies for branching and merging and how they fit in with Continuous Integration (CI). There's a bit of confusion here, particularly on the practice of feature branching and how it fits in with CI.

#### [Your Brain at Work] by [David Rock], 2009.

In his new book *Your Brain at Work*, coach David Rock depicts the story of two people over one day at the office, and what's happening in their brains that makes it so hard to focus and be productive. Not only does he explain why things go wrong, but how you can train your brain to improve thinking and performance at work. Based on interviews with 30 neuroscientists, he's developed strategies to help you work smart all day.

Learn how to:
* Maximize your mental energy by understanding your brain's limits
* Overcome distractions
* Improve your focus through understanding the nature of attention
* Reduce stress levels with brain-based techniques
* Improve how you collaborate by understanding the social needs of the brain

You can learn to be more productive, less stressed and stay sane by understanding your brain.

#### [The Myth of the Genius Programmer] by [Brian Fitzpatrick] and [Ben Collins-Sussman], 2009.

A pervasive elitism hovers in the background of collaborative software development: everyone secretly wants to be seen as a genius. In this talk, we discuss how to avoid this trap and gracefully exchange personal ego for personal growth and super-charged collaboration. We'll also examine how software tools affect social behaviors, and how to successfully manage the growth of new ideas.

#### [Programming Style & Your Brain] by [Douglas Crockford], 2011 ####

In this keynote talk from YUIConf 2011, Yahoo! JavaScript architect Douglas Crockford drops some science to explain why code style is important in programming -- particularly in JavaScript -- and how tools like JSLint can help.
